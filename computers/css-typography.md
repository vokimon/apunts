# CSS Typografy

Several fields:

- Caligraphy: Escribir a mano con buena letra (focus legibilidad)
- Lettering: Escribir a mano con letra artística (focus composición)
- Typography: Use of premade definitions of letters

Several items:

- TypeFace: the design of a collection of characters
	- ie: Helvetica, Futura...
- Font: Specific embodiment of a specific weight, witdh or style of a typeface
	- ie: Helvetica bold 10pt

Goals:

- Legibility: How easy is to identify a character in a given typeface.
- Readability: How easy is to read because how the typefaces are used. Spacing between letters, words, lines, paragraphs...
- Accessibility: How adapted to diferent functional abilities of the readers
- Scanability: How it eases the read as blocks or locate random content.

Font face features affecting Legibility:

- Baseline: Serves as common reference for reading line where the lines rest.
- Cap-height: Height of the capital letters from the base line.
- X-height: The height of most lowercase, the higher the more legible
- Descender/ascenders: Letters that go down the baseline
- Descender: Letters that go down the baseline: q, p, g...
- Ascender: Letters that go up of the x-height: d, b, l, t...
- Matching Cap-height and ascenders might affect readability: Ill.
- Serifs: adornations  of the endings of the main traces of the letters, might help readibility
	- sans serif: a font that does not have 
- Stroke contrast: diference in stroke thicknes depending on the orientation
- Counters: closed or semi-closed negative shapes. The smaller the harder to read.
- Adornments: Might distract from the character identification
- Density, quantity of ink in the paper
- Weight: both extreme light and extreme heavy weights are hard to read

Text features affecting Readability:

- Type size: too small is hard to read
- Type case: long text in all caps is hard to read
- Line spacing: 
- Long lines: (>70chars) hard to follow and changing line.
- Short lines (<45 chars) interrupts too often the reading flow.
- Color Contrast: wcag 4.5:1 contrast
- Color blindnes (Red-Green, Blue-Yellow)
	- Use browser tools to simulate it


## Typefaces genres

- Serif
	- Humanism (Janson, Kennerly Centaur):
		- First printed works 1450
		- diagonal stress
		- small x height
		- caligraphic
		- unrefined serif
	- Old-style (Palatino): 
		- 15 Century
		- more x height
		- serifs are wedge like
		- less caligraphy style
		- greater
	- Transitional (Baskervile, Bookman) 18th cnetury
	- Didone (Bodani, Didot) late 18th
		- hight contrasts (thin horizontal
		- classy
		- Flat thin lines as serif
	- Slab (Rockwell, Clarendon, Egyptienne)
		- Thick slab-like serif
		- Used in headers because the 'look at me'
- Sans Serif
	- Grotesque (Venus, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, Akzidenz-Grotesk)
		- early 19th (no sans, before that)
		- low contrast
		- low cap height (used in titles with many caps)
	- Geometric (Futura, Gotham)
		- 20s Alemania (Futuristas)
		- Based on geometric shapes (circles, squares, straight lines).
		- lowercase a, as a circle with a straight line adornation on the right
	- Neo grotesque (Helvetica, Univers, Folio, Unica, Roboto. San Francisco (SF))
		- 50s (Modernistas)
		- Thiner and simpler than Grotesque
	- Humanism Sans (Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet, Droid Sans, Lucida Grande)
		- Inspiration on the classical roman letters for capitals.
		- Inspiration on the italic script
		- Uppercases from Monumental Roman
		- swashes (decoracion exagerada)
- Scripts
	- Formal:
		- Based on scripts of writing masters from 17th and 18th centuries
	- Casual:
		- Modern script leters
		- If constrast, simulates the writting device
- Display
	- Decorative: Headers, Designs...



Resumen historico: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfRxFwVHQc>


Numbers:

- Old style figures: Go down the baseline, good for read
- Lining figures: Same height and base

Target users

- Monospace: designed for typerwriters but now used by developers, alignment of tabular data

Fix vs fluid layouts: Magazine is fix layout, while a web might depend on the device or the size or the window.

Font formats:

- OpenType  (.otf): Recommended format
- TrueType (.ttf): Former standard, missing features of otf
- EOT (.eot): Microsoft, just for IE
- WOTT (.wott): Web forms compressed
- WOOT 2 (.wott2): A more compressed version, not fully supported in ie
- Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg): 

Utility:

- Body typeface: La que se usa como base del texto denso. Focus en legibilidad.
- Display typeface: la que se usa para cabeceras, en tamaños grandes. Focus en expresividad, pero sin descuidar tampoco legibilidad.

Styles:

- Faux bold: is done by increasing the stroke width, this can be distort
- Faux italic: it is done by obliquing or slanting the font, this might distort the tone

Gradients of weight: thing, light, regular, semi-bold, bold, extra-bold

Tex size:

## Horizontal space

Measure: how many characters per line (45-75 ch per line to be readable)

Multiple columns can opt for the 45-50 smaller lines.

Tracking/Letterspacing:
- Sparse tracking 
- Condensed vs Expanded fonts
- Reduce the header tracking slightly 3-5%
	- This gives the headers more impact
- Keep the track of body, normally is set to
- Increase tracking in smallcap or uppercase

- Kerning: horizontal overlap between letters depending on the shape: TAV
- Ligatures: some letters fuse when they are closed: fi fl

## Vertical space

- Leading (line height, line spacing): distance between succesive base lines
  - A good one would be a 150%.
  - For headings it won't work, should be reduces

- Interparagraph space


Floating heading: 





## Design concepts


### Hierarchy

Guide the reader towards what it is important.
Where to begin and where to continue.
Use size, weigth, color

Reduce to a couple of typeface using complementary styles.

## Leading (line spacing)
