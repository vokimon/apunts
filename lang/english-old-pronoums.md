Back in the days:

- thou: singular second person
- you: plural second person
- you: (also) formal singular second person

The formal singular ended up being used for informal uses.

Old singular second person:

thou - ðaw - subject
thee - ðiy - object for thou (like me to I)
thy - ðay - possesive article of thou (like my for me)
thine - ðayn - possessive pronoum for thou (like mine for me)

Present simple ads -est or -st

thou walk**est** (present simple)
thou wouldst


thou art (to-be conjugation for thou)
thou shalt learn

ye - yi - object form of you, now we use you for that


you was used as the formal second person singular (like spanish vos)



who he (subject)
whom him (object)
whose his (possesive)

- whom is formal. Nowadays Who is used instead.
	- _**Whom** did you see?_ (Formal) -> _**Who did you see?_ (Informal)
	- _**To whom** is going to talk?_ (Formal) -> _**Who** is going to talk **to**?_ (Informal, notice the preposition has moved!)
	- _**With whom** did you play?_ -> _**Who** did you play **with**?_
	- Who loves whom

- Subsentences with quantifiers: Refers to a previous collective mentioned in the phrase

	- both of whom (ambos de ellos)
	- few of whom (pocos de los cuales)
	- some of whom (algunos de los cuales)
	- many of whom (muchos de los cuales)
	- several of whom (varios de los cuales)
