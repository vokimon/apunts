### Formulas:

- SomEnergia is a cooperative
    - that joins together
    - more than 20 thousands
    - electricity users,
- who want to make our own choices
    - on topic we have no choice as plain consumers.
- With the final goal
    - of changing the market to one that is more friendly to users
    - and to reduce the environmental impact of the sector.

- For instance, by becoming our own comercializers we can choose:
    - Buying 100% renewable energy
    - Adjusting prices to the real costs, or
    - Reinvesting the surplus into new renewable projects
- Still many of the sector regulation go against any alternative to the existing players and tecnologies
- But so far, we are in our fourth year and growing steady
    - we are now more than 20k members, and
    - we manage more than 25k contracts,



- At the time SomEnergia was founded,
    - some retailers, also offered renewable products
    - not 100% but sure more expensive than the regular fare
    - like many "organic" products
- That has no sense at all,
    - since renewable sources are cheaper than dirty ones
- In fact, we are now offering lower fares than most dirty energy producers
    - That's the other choice I said we can make
    - Being a small one, some processes are more expensive for us
    - But
        - We are non-profit
        - so we don't have to pay revenues to shareholders
        - We don't pay high salaries for high profile executives
        - We have no politicians to hire as advisors in exchange of favors
        - All our marketing strength comes from volunteers attending fairs and giving talks
    - So members choose to cover the costs
        - and to set stable fares that adapt as costs evolve
        - No big loses, no big gains.
- We also choose
    - to reinvest the small gains we get
    - into our own production projects
- Our initial intent was covering most of our use with our own plants
- But we are steady at the 10%
- Mostly because we are growing in contracts beyond any expectation
- But also because
    - regulation changes and bill proposals
    - are undermining the expansion of renewable sources
    - and most projects have been expectating
- Here we choosed not to be expecting anymore
    - and find new formulas we can develop new projects.


How complicated is to build such a cooperative?

- Spanish electricity market is really a hard market
- Moreover if you are starting small
- Major companies have dictated most of the bills related to the sector
- Most of them agains the users' interest
- Politicians that approved such bills got nice jobs in the sector afterwards


Aren't members setting undercost fares?

- We are the users
- We also own the cooperative
- It is our tool to change the market
- To save the environment
- By undermining the viability of the cooperative
    - we would loose that tool
- We'll choose to minimize fares
- We'll be very cautious to cover the costs we have
