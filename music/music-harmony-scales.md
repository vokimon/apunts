# Harmony: Scales ðŸŽ¶

## Diatonic scales

A diatonic scale is a scale of 7 tones (heptatonal)
that has 2 semitones steps and 5 tone steps
where the semitones are separated at least by two full tones

In summary: any rotation or transposition of the CMajor scale

Diatonic Modes:

	| N   | Name       | Pattern       | On C                | Natural notes | AKA
	|-----|------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------
	| I   | Ionian     | 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 | C D  E  F  G  A  B  | C D E F G A B | Major
	| II  | Dorian     | 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 | C D  Eb F  G  A  Bb | D E F G A B C | 
	| III | Phrygian   | 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 | C Db Eb F  G  Ab Bb | E F G A B C D | 
	| IV  | Lydian     | 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 | C D  E  F# G  A  B  | F G A B C D E | 
	| V   | Mixolydian | 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 | C D  E  F  G  A  Bb | G A B C D E F | 
	| VI  | Aeolian    | 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 | C D  Eb F  G  Ab Bb | A B C D E F G | Natural Minor
	| VII | Locrian    | 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 | C Db Eb F  Gb Ab Bb | B C D E F G A | 

Insights:

- We can get any mode with white keys just by stressing the proper root.
- Keeping the root in C, we can obtain all the modes by adding progresivelly flats (or sharps)

A mechanical way of learning modes on C,

- as we jump to the next 5th mode, we just add a flat.
- flats are chosen interleaving one from the 3 blacks and next from 2 blacks group
- pick the flat on the right
- to obtain IV we sharp instead flat and pick from left

In action:

	_x_x__x_x_x_
	o o o Xo o o IV  #4 Lydian (Exception from major sharps F)
	o o oo o o o I      Ionian (Major, the reference, all whites)
	o o oo o oX  V   b7 Mixolydian (flats B)
	o oX o o ox  II  b3 Dorian (flats E)
	o ox o oX x  VI  b6 Aeolian (flats A)
	oX x o ox x  III b2 Phrygian (flats D)
	ox x oX x x  VII b5 Locrian (flats G)
	_x_x__x_x_x_
	 4 2  5 3 1  (Order to add flats)

::: note
	If we extend the method we will get the other 5 tonalities,
	but they do not include the root (C) so they are not modes of the scale.

Each mode has their chords:

	| N   | Name       | Natural notes | Tonic | 7th | Dom  | Dom7th |
	|-----|------------|---------------|-------|-----|------|--------|
	| I   | Ionian     | C D E F G A B | CMaj  | CM7 | GMaj | G7     |
	| II  | Dorian     | D E F G A B C | Dmin  | Dm7 | Amin | Am7    |
	| III | Phrygian   | E F G A B C D | Emin  | Em7 | Bdim | Bâˆ…7    |
	| IV  | Lydian     | F G A B C D E | FMaj  | FM7 | GMaj | GM7    |
	| V   | Mixolydian | G A B C D E F | GMaj  | GM7 | Dmin | Gm7    |
	| VI  | Aeolian    | A B C D E F G | Amin  | Am7 | Emin | Em7    |
	| VII | Locrian    | B C D E F G A | Bdim  | Bâˆ…7 | FMaj | FM7    |

- The tonic (rest) chord: I III V
- The dominant (tension) chord: V VII II
- The 7th: I III V VII
- The dominant 7th: V VII II IV

The tonic chord provides the majority or minority or neither (locrian) character of the mode.

### Major modes (Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian)

- Modes with a major third (+4) are called major.
- Resting chord (tonic) is Major: I
- They bring a happy mood

Which are

- I Ionian:
	- Major key
	- The dominant 7th is the only dominant minor 7th
	- Contains B and F that lead to C and G
	- G7 C is a perfect closure (Chinpon)
	- Happy + Ritmic
- IV Lydian
	- F -> F# (augmented 4th)
	- Happy + Brilliant, magic
- V Mixolydian
	- Dominant 7th is minor with minor 7th
	- Sounds milder but also epic
	- Also epic because bVII  BbMaj
	- Happy + Epic

### Minor modes (Aeolian, Dorian, Phrygian)

- Modes with a minor third (+3) are called major.
- Resting chord (tonic) is a minor triad: ia
- They bring a sad mood

Which are

- VI Aeolian:
	- Mood: Sad + epic
	- Dominant vii
- II Dorian
	- In between Aeolean and Mixolyidian
	- Has the Epic chord of Mixolydian bVII BbMaj
	- IVMaj FMaj is also a happy/force contrast
- III Phrygian
	- Domminant is a Bâˆ…7
	- Inquietante

### Neither major neither minor

VII Locrian mode is quite special as the resting triad is a dim chord, neither major nor minor.

- VII Locrian tonic chord is neither Major nor minor, it is a dim chord
	- Weird mood
	- Resting chord is a diminished 5th chord
	- The only one with the bV

## Pentatonic scale

Pentatonic scale is used by many cultures.
An octave has 5 notes a fifth away (7 semitones).

C3 -(+7)-> G3 -(+7)-> D4 -(+7)-> A4 -(+7)-> E5

Folded in a octave and sorted: C D E G A, resulting in +2 +2+ 3 +2 +3 interval pattern.

Among the 12 existing **transpositions**, 4 are specially useful:

The ones that fit into natural notes:

- C: C D E G A
- G: G A B D E
- F: F G A C D

And the one that uses all and only altered notes:

- F#: F# G# A# C# D#

Yep, the black piano keys conforms a pentatonic scale!
A melody that you can transpose in order to use just black keys
is using a pentatonic scale.

- Major: es la unica que puede construir un acorde mayor en C (C E G), es la unica que tiene E, construida con dos segundas
- Menor: es la Ãºnica que puede construir un acorde menor en C (C D# G)
- Minor blues: Incluye la 3a menor pero no la 5a???
- Major blues: ???


Triads in Pentatonics are limited as not all diatonic notes are available.

- I, IIsus4, IIIsus4, Vsus4, vi (expressed in diatonic intervals)
- C, Dsus4, Esus4, Gsus4, Amin (C transposition)

Because of these limitations pentatonic melodies are usually harmonized with diatonic chords.

Also, pentatonics on C can be considered by the notes shared by three Diatonic Scales on C

	I IV V -> Major
	I II V -> Blues Major
	II V VI -> Suspended
	II III VI -> Minor
	III VI VII - Blues Minor

## Chromatic scale

Dodecatonic. Uses all piano keys, so 12 semitone intervals.
No modes available.

## Whole-tone hexatonic

- Whole-tone hexatonic scale has just whole-tone intervals (6*2semitones=12)
- Because the intervals are uniform, has no sense to talk about diferent modes
- Just has two transpositions:
	- The one with the lower keys of the scale in natural keys
		- C D E F# G# A#
	- The one with the lower keys of the scale in altered keys
		- Db Eb F G A B
	- On the semitone of the major scale switches from black to white keys and viceversa
- Only two triads are available.
	- In C:
		- Caug (Eaug and G#aug are just inversions)
		- Daug (F#aug and A#aug are just inversions)
	- In F:
		- Faug (Aaug and Dbaug are just inversions)
		- Gaug (Baug and Ebaug are just inversions)
- Function and mood
	- Because all the intervals are the same,
	  a listener used to diatonic scale will not find the patterns and leading tones
	- So, the scale has an unsettling and weird mood
	- Also gives the sensation of being lost
	- Used in horror movies, in the dream carrillion
	- A root can be built upon repetition or stress

## Melodic Minor scales

[Jazz scales: Melodic, Harmonic, Augmented, Diminished...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq2xt2D3e3E)

Heptatonic scales which are chromatic transpositions or rotations of the C Melodic minor scale
Like diatonic scales, also has 2 halftones and 5 fulltones, but now the two halftones are separated one fulltone.

## Non-western scales (Western classic view)

Taken from [here](https://ukebuddy.com/ukulele-scales/C-gypsy-scale)
Origins are western perspective on how it sounds.
Indeed each of those culture use many scales including some of the considered "western scales".
