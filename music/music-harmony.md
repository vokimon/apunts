# Harmony: Notes, Scales and Chords ðŸŽ¶

## Notes

- White keys (natural notes):
	- They are the notes forming the C Scale (Do Scale)
	- In Solfege they are named: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si
	- In Anglosaxon notation: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- Octaves:
	- Notes repeat in successive octaves
	- The same note doubles its frequency on the next octave
	- We diferentiate notes in different scales with the number of the octave
		- A4 is the A on the 4th octave (the middle A)
	- Phisically there are infinite octaves up and down since you can divide or multiply infinitely
	- But not all of them are audible
		- Average human audible range is 31Hz - 19KHz (aprox C0 - C10)
		- Digital recording range is 20Hz - 22KHz (C-1 - C11
		- Higher octaves have few musical interest because the harmonics of the notes are lost
		- Standard piano is A0-C8
- Black keys (altered notes):
	- Tonal distance betweens succesive white notes is not uniform
	- B-C and E-F intervals are half the interval between other succesive white keys
	- Piano black keys fill the gap between those full tones
	- Two ways of expressing them referring the neighbouring notes:
		- As sharp notes: C#, D# and F#, G#, A#. The lower note up a semitone. (sostenido/sustingut)
		- As flat notes: Db, Eb and Gb, Ab, Bb. The higher note down a semitone. (bemol)
	- The black keys starting at F#/Gb form a _Major Pentatonic Scale_
- Black and white notes build a pattern in a piano keyboard
	- `_x_x_ _x_x_x_`
	- `C D E F G A B`
	- Useful to locate the notes (start locating C)
	- Counting both, black and white notes, each octave has 12 semitones
	- Playing them all in sequence is the _Chromatic Scale_


## Tones and frequencies

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7iC-fbdKmQ

- Pitch vs frequency
	- Pitch is our perception of frequency
	- Linear increments in pitch (adding a semitone) has logaritmic increase in frequency (multiply frequency by a factor)
	- _Adding_ an octave is multiplying the frequency by 2
	- _Adding_ a semitone (12th of an octave) is multiplying the frequency by 2^(1/12) ~= 1,00057779
	- A cent is the 100th part of a semitone, so one cent multipies by 2^(1/(12*100))
- Audible range
	- You can divide a frequency by 2 never reaching 0, and of course, you can always multiply by 2
	- But at some point we fall outside the human audible range (20Hz - 22000Hz)
	- So, if we tune A4 to 440Hz (which is the standard) octaves 0 to 9 are the audible ones.
	- Reference frequency is 440Hz for A4
	- You can always divide by 2 never reaching 0: A3=220Hz, A2=110Hz, A1=55Hz, A0=27.5Hz, A-1=13.75Hz...
	- You can always multiply by 2: A5=880Hz, A6=1760Hz, A7=3520Hz, A8=7040Hz, A9=14080Hz, A10=28160Hz
- When a melodic instrument plays a note, it generates a main frequency, the **fundamental** one (f), and then many frequencies at integer multiples, the **harmonics** (2f, 3f, 4f...)
	- The fundamental frequency determines the perceived pitch
	- The harmonics, by means of its relative strenghts, gives the distintive timber to the instrument
	- Why those frequencies? Instrument vibration builds an [standing wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave).
		- The modes of vibration of the standing wave correspond to the harmonics
	- High pitches of an instrument lose the timber because harmonics move outside the audible range
- Disonance and consonance:
	- Two sounds sound disonant or detuned if many of their harmonics do not align
	- Frequencies for musical notes are chosen to be integer ratios among them so that many of their harmonics align.
	- Octave: ratio of 2, one of each pair of harmonics match (C3-C4)
	- Fifth: ratio of 3/2, the triple and second harmonics of both tones will match (C-G)
	- Augmented Fourth: More complex ratio of 64/729 (6 fiths jumps, thus (2/3)^6) generates disonance (C-F#/Gb)
- Pitagorean construction: By jumping fifths (2/3 factor) and folding the octaves in a cercle
	- 5 times, builds a pentatonic scale (CAGED)
	- 7 times, builds a diatonic scale (ie, C major scale)
	- 12 times, builds a chromatic scale
- Equal temperament
	- Notes obtained like by previous ratios (Pitagorean tunning) are not evenly distributed in frequency
	- Modern standardization moves those first 12 fifths frequencies to be evenly distributed in an octave (equal temperament)
	- The shift is not perceptually noticeable
	- Enables a single tunning for any transposition
- Referece note tunning
	- Notes are defined relative to other notes frequencies
	- Tunning is setting the frequency for a reference note
	- It could be arbitrary and still it would work as long as all the instruments use the same
	- Standard tunning plays A4 as 440Hz (often refered A440). Thus, A5 at 880Hz and A3 at 220Hz


## Scales

### Concepts

- **Scale:** an ordered set of pitches within an octave that are used for a given musical work.
	- in CMajor: C D E F G A B [C]
- **Degree:** is the position of a note within the scale. Expresed as ordinal (3rd) or in roman numerals (III).
	- In CMajor: C is I, D is II, E is III...
	- [C] is the VIII (octave=eighth)
- **Tonic note:** is the first note of the scale
	- In CMajor: The tonic is C, the first
	- In traditional western music:
		- The tonic is the note that starts a piece and returning to it is perceived as closure or tension release
		- This comes from language intonation: Returning to the starting pitch is closure.
		- Other cultures use intonation differently.
- **Step:** Refers to the tonal distance between two consecutive notes in the scale
	- CMajor scale has Tone (T) and Semitone (S) steps.
- **Interval pattern:** Tonal distances between the succesive notes of the scale.
	- In CMajor has a _Major Diatonic_ interval pattern: T T S T T T S (T=Tone, S=Semitone)
	- Expressed in semitones would be: 2 2 1 2 2 2 1
- A scale is fully specified by a tonic plus an interval pattern:
	- CMajor scale is the _Major Diatonic_ interval pattern starting at C

Derived scales: different scales can be obtained from a reference one, by rotation and transposition:

- **Degree rotation:** Playing the same set of notes but starting with a different note as tonic
	- The result is a different interval pattern obtained by rotation
		- 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 -> 2 degree rotation -> 1 2 2 2 1 2 2
	- **Mode:** Each one of those different interval patterns
	- Same set of notes, different interval pattern
	- As many modes as degrees has the scale (7 in C Major)
	- Modes named after the degree of the tonic in the reference scale
	- The mode of the chosen scale affects the emotional mood of the music
- **Chromatic transposition:** Applying the same interval pattern, starting at a different tonic
	- Generates a diferent set of notes
	- The interval pattern is kept
	- Transposition unit: semitones
	- A transposition does not change the mood but it can ease the performance with a given instrument

Scale families: each is a circular sequence of intervals, you can transpose and rotate.

- Pentatonic: 5 notes
	- 2 2 3 2 3: **Pentatonic** (5 Modes)
- Heptatonic: 6 notes
	- 2 2 2 2 2 2: **Whole tone** (1 Mode)
	- 3 2 1 1 3 2: **Blues:** (6 Modes)
- Heptatonic: 7 notes
	- 2 2 1 2 2 2 1: **Diatonic:** Dos semitonos separados por 2 y 3 tonos en cada lado (7 Modes)
	- 2 1 2 2 2 2 1: **Melodic Minor:** Dos semitonos separados 1 y 4 tonos en cada lado (7 Modes)
	- 2 2 1 2 1 3 1: **Harmonic Major:**  (7 Modes)
	- 2 1 2 2 1 3 1: **Harmonic Minor:** (7 Modes)
- Octatonic: 8 notes
	- 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1: **Diminished** (2 Modes)
- Dodecatonic: 12 notes
	- 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1: **Chromatic scale** (1 Mode)

## Intervals

Regardless to what frequency you tune a note, or to what note you start a melody,
the important musical fact is the tonal distance between the notes.

The interval is the tonal distance between two notes.

Knowing the traditional names of the intervals is useful
to understand chords names:

|semitones | interval name |
|---:|:-----|---|---|---|
| 0  | unison |
| 1  | second minor |
| 2  | second major |
| 3  | third minor |
| 4  | third major |
| 5  | perfect fourth |
| 6  | augmented fourth, or diminished fifth or tritone |
| 7  | perfect fifth |
| 8  | minor sixth |
| 9  | major sixth |
| 10 | minor seventh |
| 11 | major seventh |
| 12 | octave |
| 13 | minor nineth |

Nmemotecnics for the nomenclature:

- If the first note is C, major and perfects are the white keys and the ordinal means which white key: second, third...
- Minor and diminished are bemoled tones
- Augmented are sharpened notes
- Octave means eighth, literally

## Scale degrees

A scale degree is the position of a note within a given scale.

Within a major DiatÃ²nic scale

- 1st Tonic (C Do):
	- The first note in whichever diatonic scale.
	- Key note of the scale
	- Gives name to the "tonic triad" chord, depending on the scale is major or minor.
	- Tonal center and resolution tone
- 5th Dominant (G Sol)
	- Ratio of 2/3 with the Tonic
	- Creates tension that "wants" to resolve on tonic
- 3rd Mediant (E Mi)
	- Mitad de la triada.
	- A 3rd above the tonic
- 4th Subdominant (F Fa)
	- a 5th away down the Tonic
	- Ratio of 3/2
	- Dominant and subdominant are simetrical to the Tonic, a distance of a 5th up and down each
- 6th Submediant (A La)
	- A 3rd below the tonic
- 2nd Supertonic (D Re)
	- The note above the tonic
- 7th Leading tone (major scales) (B Si)
	- Catalan/Spanish: _Sensible_
	- The note below the tonic when at a semitone below
	- Leads to the tonic
	- 7th major interval
- 7th Subtonic (in minor scales) (B Si)
	- When the scale is minor
	- 7th minor interval


Depending on the diatonic scale we are using,
the interval between two consecutive degrees
might be a tone or a semitone.



## Chords

A **chord** is a combination of notes that sounds good played at once.
Chords usually sounds good because its frequencies have a multiplicative factor among them.
Say, each 4 cicles of one for 7 of the other.

Chords are named after the main note, called the **root note**,
and its **quality** which indicates the intervals from the root
of the other notes of the chord.


For instance, "C Major" means that the main note is C (Do).
The "Major" part of the means that the companion notes are:

- E (Mi), 4 semitones, a **major** third interval
- G (Sol), 7 semitones, a fifth interval

TODO: C Major marked in piano

We can construct a F (Fa) Major using the same 

Note that all three notes are white keys on the piano.
When this happens, it just means that the chord fits with the C scale.
But not all major chords fit in the C escale.

If we move the chord to the key D (Re),
the major third becomes a F# (Fa sostenido)
and the fifth A (La).
Note that in order the chord to become 

If we move the chord two semitones up

### Basic (Tertian) triads

Three note chords constructed by notes a major third (+4 semitones) or minor third (+3 semitones) apart.

- Both major and minor chords rely on the V dominant
- Major chord includes III (major 3rd)
- Minor chords contains bIII (minor 3rd)
- Major sounds happy, while minor sound sad
- Diminished is constructed by 2 minor 3rd intervals
- Augmented is constructed by 2 major 3rd intervals
- Diatonic scales have 3 major chords, 3 minor chords and 1 diminished chord.
- ie. CMajor: C d e F G a Bdim


| Structure | Name | Intervals | Jumps | Symbols
|------------|----|----|----|--|--|
| `C D EF G A B` | |  |  |  | 
| `x---x--x----` | Major | I III V | +4 +3 | C CMaj CM Cdelta
| `x--x---x----` | Minor | I bIII V | +3 +4 | c Cmin Cm C-
| `x--x--x-----` | Diminished | I bIII bV | +3 +3 | Cdim C^o 
| `x---x---x---` | Augmented | I III bVI | +4 +4 | Caug C+ 


### Suspended chords

Suspended chords are triads where the
third is moved (suspended) to the 2nd or the 4th.

| Structure | Name | Intervals | Jumps | Roles | Symbols
|------------|----|----|----|--|--|
| `C D EF G A B` | |  |  |  | 
| `x----x-x----` | Suspended 4th | I IV V | +5 +2 | | Csus4 Csus
| `x-x----x----` | Suspended 2nd | I II V | +2 +5 | | Csus2

Notice that:

- Sus2 on one note I is equivalent to Sus4 on its dominant V.
- Sus4 on one note I is equivalent to Sus2 on its subdominant IV.




### 7th chords

Add a major or minor 7th to a triad

| Structure | Name | Intervals | Jumps | Roles | Symbols
|------------|----|----|----|--|--|

	x-x-x--x---- Cadd9 (c + 9th)
	x-x--x-x--x- C11 (C9add11)


### Extended chords

Add a 9th an 11th or 13th to a 7th chord

- Major from major/ionian scale  Cmaj9 CM9
- Minor from natural minor/aeolian scale  Cmin9 Cm0
- Dominant from the mixolydian scale (Major with a flattened 7th)  C9

### Neapolitan chords

Outside any diatonic scale.


### Inversion / Slash chords

**Inversion:** a different order in which play the notes of a chord
The standard inversion is the one with the bass note being the root.

**Slash chords:** Inversion of the chord which has the bass note different from the root.
Named because the notation: C/G means inversion with G as the bass note.

## Modulation

Changing the key/scale in the middle of the song

- Intensify the energy level (subidon-subidon)
- In duets, adapting to the singer key
- Create interest in a monotonous song (subidon-subidon, too)
- Could lead to akward sensation

Tactics:

- Dominant bridge up (energy push): For semitone up, use the dominant chord of the target key.
	- Examples: C  F  G  C  **Ab**  Db  Gb  Ab  Db
- Pivot chords: For wider jumps, usually use in duets. Use chords that are shared by both keys. Can be combined with target dominant.
	- Example: C  Dm  G  Am  Dm  Gm7  C11  F

Considerations:

- Upwards is easier than downwards since downwards sap energy from the song
	- Changing down 4th can be see as changing up a 5th, so ok
	- But changing down semitone or tone is trick
- Harder to modulate to different signatures (either sharps or flats)
- Better to use upward modulation along intensifications on the lyrics, the singing style or volume
- Early modulation could sound abrupt, better later in the song, when the harmony has been introduced


## Chord progression

**Chord progression:** A sequence of chords.

- Different chord progressions provides different feelings to the piece
- Two transposed chord progressions provide a similar feeling
- Because of that we characterize chords in a chord progression with the intervals to their roots from the key/scale root.
- We represent the chords with roman numerals, upper case if Major, lower case if minor
	- In C Major scale: D is _II_ and Am is _vi_
	- In A minor scale: D is _VI_ and Am is _i_


## Common Pop chord progressions
