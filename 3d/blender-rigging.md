https://video.blender.org/w/5F5XomWX4jRDZYUX4tt3s8

## Rols

- CTRL **Control bones**
    - The ones the animator animate
- DEF **Deformation bones**
    - Deform the mesh
- MCH **Mechanism bones**
    - Force the rig to do what they should do


Naming:
    - DEF and MCH have the prefix. CTRL don't.
    - Important to give proper names
    - Do not let bone.001/002...
    - Left and right suffix

Advice: Do not over rig. Just what you need. (Only to learn)

Edit mode: For adding bones
Pose mode: For setting constrains and animation

Constraints:
    Owner: the bone holding the constrain
    Target/s: the affected bone/s by the constrain
